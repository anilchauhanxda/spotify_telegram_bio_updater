#### Ensure you have python 3.6+ installed
Install the pre-required librabries with `pip install telethon requests`

## Setup <a name = "setup"></a>
- Get your spotify CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).

- Get your telegram app API_ID and API_HASH fromÂ https://my.telegram.org

- Copy [this link](https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback&scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-read-currently-playing+user-follow-read+user-read-recently-played+user-top-read+playlist-read-private+playlist-modify-private+user-follow-modify+user-read-private), change `CLIENT_ID` with your spotify `clinet_id`. Paste it in browser.

- After you grant permission, you get redirected to `https://example.com/callback?code=` . Copy everything after the ```code=```, this is your INITIAL_TOKEN.

- Paste all these values in their respective variables at [constants.py](/constants.py)
- While you are at it, you can also paste an initial biography there. Just take your current one. This is highly recommended. If you don't do this and have a currently playing track, the bot has at its first start no idea what your original biography is. Just do it, please

- If you want to have a log channel or group or so, paste its invite link or id in the `LOG` variable. If you leave it at "me", you will see those in your saved chat. Only if errors occur ofc ;)

- Now you can run [generate.py](/generate.py). This will generate a json file named database.

- You are almost done. If you now run bot.py, all you need to do is log into your telegram account and start using the bot!

### Warning
This bot uses the emojiÂ to determine if the currentÂ  bio is an active spotify biography or not. This means you mustn't use this emoji on your original biographies or the bot will probably break. Don't do it, thanks.

### But I want to
Great news. Just change the KEY variable in [constants](/constants.py) file. Don't ever use your new KEY in your biographies though!
